Redux app from scratch

:boom: Do NOT use the one on training kit (the one about cars) :boom:
BUILD A TODO APP USING REDUX, FROM SCRATCH
The functionality should be just like yesterday's afternoon project
You can use your todo app from yesterday as well as today's guided project to help you
Create a new CRA app, and make a repo on Github to put it in.
Add your TL as collaborator etc.


// design of the slices of state --> { count: 0 } // single slice "count"
// single action type "INCREASE_BY_ONE"
// single reducer "countReducer"
// single action creator "increaseByOne"
// a single "connected" component that gets the "count" and the "increaseByOne"
